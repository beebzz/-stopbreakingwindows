             <h2>Because of breaking windows?</h2>
             <p>The name sounds a bit weird, but Broken Windows Policing is actually a policing model emphasized by NYPD Commisioner Bill Bratton; 
             it argues that when misdemeanors and small crimes such as petty theft or marijuana possession 
             are more harshly punished, the probability of higher crimes occuring is reduced.  This model 
             was introduced in 1982 by George Kelling, a criminologist and former professor at Rutgers University, 
             and James Wilson, a political scientist and retired professor, whom based their research on a 
             foot-patrol experiment conducted in Newark during the late-1970s.</p>

            <h3 id="evidence">Well, does it work?</h3>
            <p>Think about it this way: crime rates across America started to decline in the early 1990s,
               and that's around the time that BWP was emphasized across the NYPD. But, according to a 2002 
               academic paper by Criminologist Richard Rosenfield, "homicide rates also have decreased sharply 
               in cities that did not noticeably alter their policing policies, such as Los Angeles, or that 
               instituted very different changes from those in New York, such as San Diego".</p>
            <p>In other words, broken windows policing wasn't able to actually lower crime rates in the U.S at all.</p>
            <p>For more context, check out the excerpt from the Los Angeles Times down below.</p>
            <p id="special" style="margin-top: 40px; border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#D1BB29; padding: 1em;">"no evidence [was found] for the proposition that disorder causes crime or that "broken windows" policing reduces serious crime. Rather, the pattern of crime reduction across New York precincts during the 1990s, when Bratton was first experimenting with "broken windows" policing, is entirely consistent with what statisticians call "mean reversion." Those precincts that experienced the largest drops in crime in the 1990s were the ones that experienced the largest increases in crime during the city's crack epidemic of the mid- to late-1980s. What goes up must come down -- and it would have come down even if New York had not embarked on its quality-of-life initiative" -- Bernard E. Harcourt

         backs a letter to Commissioner Bratton asking to disencourage Broken Windows Policing among the NYPD.</p>
